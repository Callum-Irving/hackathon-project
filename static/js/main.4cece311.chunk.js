E-waste is a huge problem. All of the electronics we discard contain toxic chemicals and when they end up in a landfill, these chemicals leach into the ground. E-waste is much more of a problem today because there's so much new technology being produced. As an example, people are switching out their smartphones quicker than ever before and it\u2019s partly because all the new electronic devices are being \u2018designed for the dump\u2019. That means that companies are designing their products in a way that the products are hard to repair and they become obsolete quickly, forcing consumers to buy new devices more often. E-waste will continue to grow as a problem if left unnoticed because Moore\u2019s law states that about every 18 months, the processors designed double in speed. This means that about every 18 months, the E-waste will also increase significantly. Simple things such as taking care of your device\u2019s battery and not overcharging it, allowing it to retain its charge for longer, can all extend the liespan of electronics. It can also be things like putting cases on smartphones and tablets to prolong their life span. Increasing the life of your devices will mean that you need to upgrade less frequently, reducing E-waste. But when the time comes, we all need to dispose of our waste in the correct location, instead of dumping it in the garbage. This is because electronics often contain poisonous chemicals that can leach into the Earth. Thus, they should be disposed of at a location that accepts OES E-waste. For all of us in Waterloo, the closest location accepting E-waste is D - Gibson Sound & Vision and they are located at 25 Columbia St E, Waterloo."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:" Why it\u2019s important to reduce waste and dispose of it properly?"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{className:"info-paragraph",children:"Over 300 million tons of plastic is produced every year and at least 8 million tons of that ends up in our oceans. These 8 million tons make up 80% of all marine debris, whether that be on the surface or in sediment, deep under the ocean. This plastic interferes with the marine species and it can poison them if they consume the plastic and even kill them. Plastic pollution is not only harmful to the marine animals but it can also be harmful to the local people that survive on a mainly seafood diet. They may not even realize that they are ingesting plastic in the form of microplastics, which is what happens when plastic is exposed to the elements such as UV rays, ocean currents, wind, and other natural elements. It also harms the planet as a whole because the plastic on the surface leads to climate change. This is because the plastic is not able to allow the plankton to photosynthesize and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Also, when this plastic waste is incinerated it releases carbon dioxide back into the environment because plastic is a petroleum product. To manage this, governments and research institutions will have to find a biodegradable material which is just as versatile as plastic but is less harmful to the environment. However, us mere civilians are not out of the picture, we can alter our lifestyles slightly to chnage how much plastic ends up in the ocean. It can start from simple things like buying reusable water bottles, taking reusable bags when we go grocery shopping, buying in bulk, just to name a few. The main idea behind all of this is to reduce the amount of plastic we use in the first place. However, as of the current situation, it is almost impossible to live a life without plastic which is where our web app myWaste comes in. myWaste will allow you to monitor how much waste you are producing as a community and will allow you to set goals to reduce your waste production."})]})},d=(a(198),a(333)),u=a(337),b=a(168),m=a(169),p=a(71),j=a(68),g=a(177);var f=[{name:"Laurelwood",Garbage:4e3,Recycling:2400,Compost:2400},{name:"Westvale",Garbage:3e3,Recycling:1398,Compost:2210},{name:"Beechwood",Garbage:2e3,Recycling:9800,Compost:2290},{name:"Westmount",Garbage:2780,Recycling:3908,Compost:2e3},{name:"Vista Hills",Garbage:1890,Recycling:4800,Compost:2181},{name:"Lakeshore",Garbage:2390,Recycling:3800,Compost:2500},{name:"Eastbridge",Garbage:3490,Recycling:4300,Compost:2100}];var w=function(){return Object(r.jsx)("div",{className:"app",children:Object(r.jsxs)(d.a,{width:1400,height:750,data:f,margin:{top:20,right:30,left:20,bottom:5},children:[Object(r.jsx)(u.a,{strokeDasharray:"3 3"}),Object(r.jsx)(b.a,{dataKey:"name"}),Object(r.jsx)(m.a,{}),Object(r.jsx)(p.a,{}),Object(r.jsx)(j.a,{}),Object(r.jsx)(g.a,{dataKey:"Garbage",stackId:"a",fill:"#8884d8"}),Object(r.jsx)(g.a,{dataKey:"Recycling",stackId:"a",fill:"#82ca9d"}),Object(r.jsx)(g.a,{dataKey:"Compost",stackId:"a",fill:"#c2e0e3"})]})})},y=a(17),O=a(18),x=(a(330),a(338)),v=a(339),k=a(172),E=a(173),G=a(170),C=[{subject:"Recycle",A:76,B:76,fullMark:150},{subject:"Green Bin",A:28,B:130,fullMark:150},{subject:"Garbage",A:120,B:130,fullMark:150}],N=function(e){e.handleClose;var t=Object(s.useState)(""),a=Object(O.a)(t,2),n=a[0],i=a[1],o=Object(s.useState)(""),c=Object(O.a)(o,2),l=c[0],h=(c[1],Object(s.useState)("")),d=Object(O.a)(h,2),u=d[0],b=d[1];return Object(r.jsxs)(r.Fragment,{children:[Object(r.jsx)("h1",{children:"Household Waste Produce"}),Object(r.jsxs)("form",{onSubmit:function(e){e.preventDefault(),console.log(n,l),fetch("https://hacktheearth-project.herokuapp.com/",{method:"POST",credentials:"include",body:{address:n,password:l},redirect:"follow",mode:"no-cors"}).then((function(e){console.log(e)})),b(!0)},children:[Object(r.jsx)("input",{label:"Address",variant:"filled",required:!0,value:n,onChange:function(e){return i(e.target.value)}}),Object(r.jsxs)("div",{style:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",alignItems:"center"},children:[Object(r.jsx)("button",{type:"submit",variant:"contained",color:"primary",children:"Get Data"}),Object(r.jsxs)(x.a,{className:u?"show":"noshow",cx:300,cy:250,outerRadius:150,width:500,height:500,data:C,children:[Object(r.jsx)(v.a,{}),Object(r.jsx)(k.a,{dataKey:"subject"}),Object(r.jsx)(E.a,{}),Object(r.jsx)(G.a,{name:"Mike",dataKey:"A",stroke:"#8884d8",fill:"#8884d8",fillOpacity:.6})]})]})]})]})};var T=function(){return Object(r.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(r.jsx)(l,{}),Object(r.jsxs)(y.c,{children:[Object(r.jsx)(y.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:h}),Object(r.jsx)(y.a,{path:"/data_visualization",component:w}),Object(r.jsx)(y.a,{path:"/login",component:N})]})]})};o.a.render(Object(r.jsx)(n.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(r.jsx)(c.a,{children:Object(r.jsx)(T,{})})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[332,1,2]]]);
